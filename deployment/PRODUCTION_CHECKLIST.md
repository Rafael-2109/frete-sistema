## Deployment Process ⚙️

### Pre-Deployment Steps
1. **Freeze code changes** - No new commits to main branch
2. **Run final test suite** - Ensure all tests pass
3. **Backup current production** - Database and application state
4. **Notify stakeholders** - Deployment window communication
5. **Scale infrastructure** - Prepare for increased load

### Deployment Execution
1. **Execute deploy script** - `./deployment/production/deploy_production.sh`
2. **Monitor deployment** - Watch logs and metrics
3. **Run health checks** - `python deployment/production/health_verify.py`
4. **Execute smoke tests** - `python deployment/production/smoke_tests.py`
5. **Verify SSL/CDN** - Check certificate and cache behavior

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application responding correctly
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] All API endpoints functional
- [ ] Frontend assets loading
- [ ] CDN cache warming complete
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards showing green

## Rollback Procedure 🔄

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Application not responding
- Critical functionality broken
- Database connection failures
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance degradation > 50%

### Rollback Steps
1. **Execute rollback script** - `./deployment/production/rollback_production.sh`
2. **Restore database** - If schema changes were made
3. **Verify rollback** - Run health checks on previous version
4. **Clear CDN cache** - Ensure old assets are purged
5. **Notify stakeholders** - Communicate rollback completion
