0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel subagents to learn specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `app/` with up to 250 parallel subagents to understand existing code.
0d. Reference CLAUDE.md for field names and conventions.

1. Use up to 500 subagents to study existing source code in `app/*` and compare against `specs/*`. Analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted by priority. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped tests, and inconsistent patterns.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `app/utils` and `app/shared` as the project's standard library.
