# Architecture Decision Record: Hierarchical Permission System

## ADR-001: Permission System Redesign

**Date**: 2024-01-26  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Context**: The current permission system lacks hierarchical structure and batch management capabilities  
**Decision Makers**: System Architecture Team

## Context and Problem Statement

The existing permission system has several limitations:
1. Flat structure without hierarchy (no category grouping)
2. No batch operations for managing multiple users
3. Limited inheritance and override capabilities
4. Module-level permissions don't cascade to submodules efficiently
5. No UI for managing complex permission structures

## Decision Drivers

1. **Scalability**: System must handle 1000+ users with complex permissions
2. **Usability**: Non-technical users must be able to manage permissions
3. **Performance**: Permission checks must be < 50ms
4. **Flexibility**: Support future permission types and structures
5. **Auditability**: Complete audit trail for compliance

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Enhance Current Flat Structure
- **Pros**: Minimal migration effort, maintains compatibility
- **Cons**: Doesn't solve hierarchy needs, limited scalability

### Option 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Pros**: Industry standard, well understood
- **Cons**: Too rigid for our vendor/team requirements

### Option 3: Hierarchical Attribute-Based Access Control (HABAC)
- **Pros**: Flexible, supports complex rules, natural hierarchy
- **Cons**: More complex implementation

### Option 4: Hybrid Hierarchical + Attribute System ✓
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, flexible yet structured
- **Cons**: Requires significant redesign

## Decision

We will implement **Option 4: Hybrid Hierarchical + Attribute System** with the following architecture:

### 1. Three-Level Hierarchy
```
Category (e.g., "Commercial Operations")
└── Module (e.g., "Order Management")  
    └── SubModule (e.g., "Create Orders")
```

### 2. Permission Types
- View (Read-only access)
- Edit (Create/Update)
- Delete (Remove)
- Export (Data extraction)

### 3. Inheritance Model
- Permissions cascade down by default
- SubModules can override Module permissions
- Custom overrides are explicitly marked

### 4. User Associations
- N:N relationship with vendors
- N:N relationship with sales teams
- Automatic data filtering based on associations

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-1: Database Schema Design

**Decision**: Use normalized relational schema with junction tables

**Rationale**:
- Maintains referential integrity
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Supports complex permission inheritance
- Enables comprehensive audit trails

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- NoSQL: Less suitable for relational data
- JSON columns: Poor query performance
- Denormalized schema: Data consistency issues

### AD-2: Permission Resolution Algorithm

**Decision**: Bottom-up resolution with caching

**Algorithm**:
1. Check SubModule permission (if exists)
2. Check Module permission (if no override)
3. Check Category permission (if no override)
4. Apply default (deny)

**Rationale**:
- Most specific permission wins
- Predictable behavior
- Efficient with caching

### AD-3: API Design

**Decision**: RESTful API with hierarchical endpoints

**Structure**:
```
/api/v1/permissions/categories/{id}/modules/{id}/submodules/{id}
```

**Rationale**:
- Intuitive resource organization
- Supports partial updates
- Easy to cache and scale

### AD-4: UI Component Architecture

**Decision**: React-based tree component with virtual scrolling

**Key Components**:
- PermissionTree (recursive rendering)
- CheckboxGroup (consistent permission controls)
- BatchOperations (bulk management)

**Rationale**:
- Handles large permission sets efficiently
- Familiar tree UI pattern
- Supports real-time updates

### AD-5: Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-level caching with Redis

**Cache Levels**:
1. User effective permissions (5 min TTL)
2. Permission structure (1 hour TTL)
3. Vendor/Team associations (10 min TTL)

**Rationale**:
- Reduces database load
- Sub-50ms permission checks
- Automatic invalidation on changes

### AD-6: Audit Implementation

**Decision**: Comprehensive audit log with risk scoring

**Tracked Events**:
- All permission changes
- Batch operations
- Access attempts
- Configuration changes

**Rationale**:
- Compliance requirements
- Security monitoring
- Troubleshooting capability

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Migration (Week 1-2)
1. Create new schema alongside existing
2. Build migration scripts
3. Implement rollback capability

### Phase 2: API Development (Week 3-4)
1. Core permission CRUD endpoints
2. Batch operation endpoints
3. Audit and reporting APIs

### Phase 3: UI Implementation (Week 5-6)
1. Permission tree component
2. Batch operations interface
3. Audit log viewer

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 7-8)
1. Integration with existing systems
2. Performance testing
3. Security assessment

### Phase 5: Rollout (Week 9-10)
1. Pilot with small user group
2. Gradual rollout
3. Monitor and optimize

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching early, load test thoroughly

### Risk 2: Data Migration Errors
- **Mitigation**: Dual-write period, comprehensive validation

### Risk 3: User Adoption
- **Mitigation**: Intuitive UI, training materials, gradual rollout

### Risk 4: Security Vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Security review, penetration testing

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: 95% of permission checks < 50ms
2. **Scalability**: Support 10,000+ users
3. **Usability**: 80% task completion rate without training
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
5. **Adoption**: 90% of admins using new system within 30 days

## Future Considerations

1. **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection for permission usage
2. **Workflow Integration**: Approval workflows for permission changes
3. **Mobile Support**: Native mobile app for permission management
4. **Federation**: Support for external identity providers
5. **Time-based Permissions**: Temporary access grants

## Decision Outcomes

### Expected Benefits
1. Simplified permission management
2. Reduced administrative overhead
3. Better security through granular control
4. Improved compliance with audit trails
5. Scalability for future growth

### Technical Debt Addressed
1. Removes hardcoded permission checks
2. Eliminates duplicate permission logic
3. Centralizes permission management
4. Provides clear upgrade path
