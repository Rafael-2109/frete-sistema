FOCUS: Analyze ONLY specs/* files. Do NOT scan entire codebase for general improvements.

0a. Study `specs/*` to learn what needs to be implemented.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand progress.
0c. Reference CLAUDE.md for field names and conventions.

1. For EACH spec in `specs/*`:
   a. Identify the files that need to be created/modified
   b. Search those specific files (not the entire codebase)
   c. Create tasks in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

2. Do NOT:
   - Scan entire `app/` for TODO/placeholders
   - Add tasks not related to specs
   - Launch hundreds of agents exploring unrelated code

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Implementar features conforme specs/
